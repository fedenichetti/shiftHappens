# IOV Planner — input parsers.
#
# Reads the three xlsx files supplied by the caposala (PROSPETTO inter-unit
# night rota, residents' desiderata workbook, attendings' absences) and turns
# them into the `parsed_inputs` state described in spec §4.2.
#
# Public functions:
#   - read_iov_prospetto(path)
#   - read_iov_desiderata_specializzandi(path, sheet)
#   - read_iov_assenze_specialisti(path)
#   - read_iov_inputs(prospetto_path, desiderata_path, assenze_path, target_month)
#
# All public functions return tibbles (or, in the case of read_iov_inputs, a
# named list of tibbles). No package state is mutated. All package access is
# namespace-qualified — no library() calls.
#
# Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-21-iov-planner-design.md §4.

# (functions added in subsequent tasks)
